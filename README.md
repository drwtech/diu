## summary
The code of this tool is the Golang code that uses the code of this [article](https://www.jianshu.com/p/8006dd496e00) and is converted by the [aicodeconvert](https://aicodeconvert.com/). 

Since the final converted code is not available, it needs to be adjusted manually, but it also greatly improves the programming efficiency. Thank you very much!
